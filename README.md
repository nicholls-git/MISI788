APPLYING HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS AND DIGITAL FORENSICS: A PYTHON FRAMEWORK
Version 2.0
April 20, 2022

The objective of this project is to create an application that generates custom wordlists that lead to faster password cracking than publicly available password lists or randomly generated guesses. 

The program takes a user specified amount of inputs (i.e. something likely used in a password) and manipulates them a user specified amount of times to create a tailored password list for use in OCO, digital forensics, or penetration testing.
